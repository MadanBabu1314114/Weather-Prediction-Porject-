This project aims to predict weather conditions using machine learning classifiers based on the dataset available on Kaggle. The two classifiers utilized are the Gradient Boosting Classifier and AdaBoost Classifier. The achieved accuracy rates for these classifiers are 82% and 79%, respectively.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project can be found on Kaggle at the following link: [Weather Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananthr1/weather-prediction).

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **`models/`**: Saved machine learning models.
 

## Setup

 **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MadanBabu1314114/weather-prediction-project.git
    cd weather-prediction-project
    ```

 

## Usage

1. **Data Retrieval:**
    - If the dataset is not included in the repository, you may need to download it manually from the Kaggle link provided and place it in the `data/` directory.

2. **Data Exploration:**
    - Explore the dataset using the Jupyter notebooks  

3. **Model Training:**
    - Train the Gradient Boosting Classifier and AdaBoost Classifier in the jupyter notebook

4. **Evaluation:**
    - Evaluate the models and analyze their performance using the notebooks.

5. **Predictions:**
    - Use the trained models to make predictions on new data.

## Results

- **Gradient Boosting Classifier:**
    - Accuracy: 82%

- **AdaBoost Classifier:**
    - Accuracy: 79%
